			welcome<br />
			<br />
			tommy williams is<br />
			- designer: i design solutions to your problems<br />
			- developer: i develop code to achieve that design<br />
			<br />
			i can build your website from scratch or work off your template<br />
			i can design phone apps, but cannot develop or publish them<br />
			<br />
			most of my work is on the front end: what the user sees and interacts
			with<br />
			- html<br />
			- css<br />
			- javascript<br />
			- adobe photoshop / illustrator<br />
			<br />
			i also take on back end work: databases and scripts of more complex
			sites<br />
			- php<br />
			- mysql<br />
			- ruby on rails<br />
			<br />
			i emphasize<br />
			- mobile: as good as, if not better than the desktop site<br />
			- user interface / experience: the user understands what to do and enjoys
			doing it<br />
			- rapid development: focus on delivering a working prototype asap over
			long planning phases<br />
			- clean / efficient code: other developers can easily interpret and edit
			my code<br />
			<br />
			i am more familiar with<br />
			- mac over pc<br />
			- android over iphone<br />
